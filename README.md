Analysis on Kickstarter data to determine factors for campaign outcomes
o What are some limitations of this dataset?
Data includes outcomes from more than one country, interpretation of trends for decision-making will need to be adjusted for the demographic area and its particular market. 
Clients play based in US, a month run, 10 backers, relationship sonnets.
Different topics/genres of plays are included in the data set to create deliverables. Trend of success may follow the subject of the play as well.

 



o What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
a. A stacked bar graph could be beneficital in visually the trends of successful to failed outcomes. In both line charts created a strong mirroring is evident. The stacked comparison of successful to failed may yield a better view of portions of the year when campaigns are most successful. Of those windows, Pledge goal brackets reflected as successful during those times would be the best window for launching a kickstarter.
